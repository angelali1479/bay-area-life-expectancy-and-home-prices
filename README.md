# Bay Area Life Expectancy and Home Prices

## Background

For this mini project, I utilized data from [Vital Signs](https://www.vitalsigns.mtc.ca.gov/) to look at the relationship between life expectancy and home prices in order to compare data from the Bay Area to data from Baltimore and make conclusions that may apply to both locations. 

## Data Analysis

It was difficult to get both data sets on the same graph due to the differences in the y-axis, but we can still observe a similar trend across both line graphs. The x-axis consists of the zip codes and they are ordered in ascending order so that the trends will be comparable across both line graphs. The median housing price graph has a slightly altered x-axis by excluding all NaN values in order to make the line graph continuous, but the change is not so large as to affect the shape of the graph significantly. As we can see in the graphs above, both graphs follow a similar shape, with peaks and intense variations at the same zip codes. We can surmise that the two variables, life expectancy and home prices, have a positive relationship in some way.

## Conclusions

We chose to compare a different location's variables to Baltimore's in order to see if there are other variables that we should consider in our final analysis. We can also use the Bay Area data to look for policies that worked in the Bay Area that could also work in Baltimore. Housing prices are an indicator of personal wealth of the owners and how good the economy is in the area. Housing prices in the Bay Area are always generally fairly high and we can assume that the higher the housing price, the more personal wealth or income the owner has. Since the housing price graph and life expectancy graph follow the same shape and trend, we can extrapolate and surmise that the higher the housing price, the higher the income of the owner, and the higher the life expectancy. This leads to our ultimate conclusion that higher income does indeed lead to higher life expectancy. This is a relationship we found in our Baltimore data as well and which can be enforced with what we have analyzed from the Bay Area data.
