# Bay Area Life Expectancy and Home Prices

## Background

For this mini project, I utilized data from [Vital Signs](https://www.vitalsigns.mtc.ca.gov/) to look at the relationship between life expectancy and home prices in order to compare data from the Bay Area to data from Baltimore and make conclusions that may apply to both locations. 

## Data Analysis

It was difficult to get both data sets on the same graph due to the differences in the y-axis, but we can still observe a similar trend across both line graphs. The x-axis consists of the zip codes and they are ordered in ascending order so that the trends will be comparable across both line graphs 

## Conclusions
